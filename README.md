# NYC_Citibike_Tableau

## Overview and Purpose

The purpose of the project is provide help to Kate, she wants to start a bike-sharing business in Des Moines, IA. In order to understand the business, we used the data collected from NYC Citibike's bike-sharing project to see when and how the bikes were used. The following analysis will use Tableau to show Kate the data in visual graphs that would help to understand the data better.

## Results

- Checkout Stats:

Checkout Stats gives us a view into the ride duration of each trip. We can see that the majority of all rides are <20 mins each. The duration also matches across genders. There is no difference who rides our bikes, or for what reason, trips are short.

- Bike Movement:

Bikes generally do not move very far from the starting location. Or, at least, there is a "net-zero" movement effect. We do not see a migration problem where bikes travel from one side of the city and are left on the other side creating a bike location management problem.

- Weekday Stats:

Typically, NYC Citibikes are used heavily during weekday commuting hours. Conversely, on the weekends the bikes have low, yet consistent usage during the midday. Customers tend to be Subscribers over single use customers.

- Weekday Stats (cont.):

Here is another view of Weekday Stats by Gender. The same frequency of riding occurs across genders. Weekdays see heavy usage for commuting hours and weekends have consistent usage during the day.

## Summary
The vacation in NYC was amazing and riding the network of Citibikes helped the experience. However, the prospects of starting a business in Des Moines, IA is still inconclusive. Much of the usage comes from subscribers and commuters and not casual tourists. There is a lot to see in Manhattan and without a commuting map or a landmark map to compliment Kate's idea, I don't think that investors would jump at the idea of Citibikes in Des Moines, IA.
